        <h1>Domestic and International Tours</h1>

        <p>CrickSync Academy’s International Exposure Program is designed to groom the next generation of Bangladesh cricket stars by giving them experiences that go far beyond local boundaries and truly enrich their cricketing journey.</p>

        <ul class="tour-benefits">
            <li>Our players regularly compete in high-quality matches and tournaments against strong teams from across Bangladesh and abroad, exposing them to a wide variety of playing styles, bowling attacks, batting approaches, and team strategies.</li>
            <li>By playing in different cities and countries, our cricketers learn to quickly adapt to varying pitch behaviour, weather conditions, outfield speeds, and ground dimensions — making them truly versatile and match-ready for any situation, just like our senior Tigers.</li>
            <li>These exposure tours and camps are not just about playing more cricket; they provide a deeper understanding of advanced game tactics, reading match situations, smart decision-making under pressure, and modern cricketing strategies.</li>
            <li>Interacting and sharing the dressing room with players and coaches from different cricketing cultures helps our young talents absorb new techniques, fresh ideas, and global best practices — broadening their vision and accelerating their growth into complete cricketers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="highlight-quote">
            At CrickSync Academy, we believe real champions are built not just in the nets, but on the field, in new environments, against new challenges.<br>
            <strong>Join us — and take the first step toward representing Bangladesh on the world stage!</strong>
