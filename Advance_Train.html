        <ul class="atp-features">
            <li>The Advanced Training Program has been specially designed under the guidance of former Bangladesh national cricketers and BCB Level-3 certified coaches to produce the next generation of Tigers.</li>
            <li>This elite <strong>01-year program</strong> is offered for four age groups — <strong>Under-14, Under-16, Under-19, and Under-23</strong> — with <strong>5 sessions per week (4 hours each)</strong>: 3 hours of high-intensity skill coaching + 1 hour of specialised strength, speed & fitness training.</li>
            <li>Every batch is guided by a complete professional support team: <strong>Head Coach, Senior Coach, Assistant Coach, Specialist Thrower, BCB-accredited Physiotherapist, and full-time Strength & Conditioning Trainer</strong> — ensuring 360-degree development.</li>
            <li>The ATP transforms young players into complete professionals in their chosen discipline — <strong>batting, bowling, wicket-keeping, or all-rounder</strong> — with individual skill correction, video analysis, and personalised development plans.</li>
            <li>One-to-one mentoring and daily counselling sessions are conducted by some of Bangladesh’s finest coaching talents — many of whom have coached at <strong>BCB High Performance (HP) Unit, Bangladesh U-19, A-team, and premier division club levels</strong>.</li>
            <li>Programs of this intensity and structure are normally available only at the <strong>BCB National Cricket Academy, Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla Stadium HP camps</strong> — CrickSync now brings the same elite ecosystem to aspiring cricketers across all eight divisions.</li>
            <li>The curriculum has been built in complete alignment with current international standards and Bangladesh’s unique playing conditions — spin-friendly pitches, humid weather, seam movement, and the mental toughness required to succeed in sub-continental and global cricket.</li>
        </ul>
